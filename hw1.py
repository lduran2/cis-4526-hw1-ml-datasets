# Changelog :
#     v1.3 - 2021-09-13t23:29
#         uses the first row as a control row for non-numerical data
#
#     v1.2.3 - 2021-09-13t23:11
#         calculating the average rate of failure as error properly
#
#     v1.2.2 - 2021-09-13t22:34
#         calculating probability for each feature as error
#
#     v1.2.1 - 2021-09-13t22:24
#         now counting the rows for the number of samples
#
#     v1.1 - 2021-09-13t21:53
#         reading the names of the features from the CSV files
#
#     v1.0 - 2021-09-13t21:42
#         added argument support, cleaned up the template a bit
